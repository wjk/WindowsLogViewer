# Windows Log Viewer

This repository contains an alternative implementation of the Windows 10/11 Event Viewer application.
This version of the tool is more attractive-looking than the Windows Vista-era design of the inbox
viewer, and ours is *much* faster.

## To Run

1. Download and install [the .NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.202-windows-x64-binaries).
2. Open a command prompt, cd into this directory
3. cd into the src\WindowsLogViewer directory
4. Run `dotnet run`. After a brief delay while the project is built, the program should launch.
